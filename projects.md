Here is a quick breakdown of projects I've worked on

### Gene Signature Research and Analysis Bioinformatics Project

I'm including the description of this project and then some materials that I contributed to for our submission in my Bioinformatics course

## TCSS 478 Final Group Project, Spring 2022
 
In class and asynchronous materials, we have discussed high-throughput technologies, such as microarrays and sequencing, that can measure gene expression levels of thousands or tens of thousands of genes simultaneously. We also introduced bioinformatics resources and software tools that can be used to analyze biomedical data. The goal of this final project is to identify gene signatures relevant to the transcriptional response to COVID-19 in humans.

This is a crowdsourcing project in which each team will identify gene signatures from a different gene expression dataset. In the last task, each team will evaluate gene signatures computed by another team.

Published in March of 2020,  the journal, “SARS-CoV-2 launches a unique transcriptional signature from in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo systems”, sought to understand the host response to the virus and how this response compared to other viruses. This was done with the hope that it would lead to treatment breakthroughs early on during the COVID pandemic. For our tasks, we set out to replicate some of their results using the gene expression data provided in the journal as well as identify differentially expressed genes. We used the standard R ‘cor’ and ‘cor.test’ functions for correlations, the standard ‘t.test’ for finding differential expression, and we adjusted the p-values from our ‘t.test’ findings using ‘p.adjust’ with the ‘fdr’(false discovery rate) method.
