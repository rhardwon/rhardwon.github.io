title: Leetcode 121 Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
---
This will be a write up for Leetcode 121 but also a learning process for blogging with Jekyll on github pages. 

We are given an array that represent the price of a single stock for 7 days. We don't have a time machine so we need to buy the stock before we can sell it. Our first example input we have the prices array = [7,1,5,3,6,4] and our expected output is 5. We should get that 5 by buying on the second day at 1 and selling on the fifth day at 6.

This is relatively simple although more complicated than first glance. I started by trying to only maintain the highest value and lowest value, but the timing restriction requires more work than that. 

I realized the data we are dependent on is actually our minimum seen price and our currently stored maximum sale price. Our **if** and **else if** logic ends up doing a lot of heavy lifting for us in this solution as we actually check our logic conditions perfectly and adjust only when needed, then return the maximum stored value. When done correctly this allows us to set maximum to 0 in the beginning and return that appropriately if a profit is never found and for other corner cases that might arise.

`class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        minimum = prices[0]
        maximum = 0
        
        for i in range(len(prices)):
            if prices[i] < minimum:
                minimum = prices[i]
            elif prices[i] - minimum > maximum:
                maximum = prices[i] - minimum
        return maximum`
